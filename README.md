# Cricket-Prophet: AI-Powered Cricket Score Prediction

**Predict cricket scores with accuracy beyond traditional encounter-based or runrate-based predictions!**

## Key Features

- **Live score scraping:** Stays up-to-date with real-time match data.
- **Intelligent prediction:** Leverages a Random Forest model for comprehensive analysis.
- **Factors beyond run rate:** Considers wickets left, last 5 overs, and more for precise predictions.
- **Comprehensive metrics:** Track MSE scores of 11.68 for T20 and 20.44 for ODI formats.

## Get Started

- **Explore the app:** https://cricket-prophet.streamlit.app/

## How It Works

1. **Live score scraping:** Fetches live match data from CricBuzz.
2. **Feature engineering:** Extracts relevant features from the match data and tried to predict deviation of score from projected score
3. **Model prediction:** Applies a pre-trained Random Forest model to predict the final score.
4. **Visualization:** Displays predictions and insights clearly.

## Performance Insights

### Why is it better than runrate based projected score?

Refer to the below table, think of variance as MSE of projected score

| Format | Measuring after n balls played | Variance (Train) | Variance (Test) | Model MSE (Train) | Model MSE (Test) |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| T20    | 30                             | 498.41           | 514.90          | 9.02              | 9.26             |

| ODI    | 240                            | 134.28           | 125.87          | 4.33              | 5..06            |
